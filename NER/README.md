# Named Entities Recognition

**Note**: Please run `pip install requirements.txt` before run anything.
Dataset is downloaded from [here](https://github.com/synalp/NER/tree/master/corpus/CoNLL-2003). And the dataset that I used is `eng.train` - train, `eng.testa` - validate, `eng.testb` - test

1. Check `bilstm_crf.ipynb` for running example.
2. To use this code, please run command: `python main.py`
3. Check the result in `train.png` and `accuracy.png`
